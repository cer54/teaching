This folder only contains the files (config.json, objects.json and the *.mkdn files) that need to be edited by the user. The 'd3-process-map' app can be obtained from https://github.com/nylen/d3-process-map

All you need to do to run these files is to put them into a new folder in d3-process-map/data and then add the appropriate query string as shown in the d3-procees-map repository readme
